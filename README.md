# Overview

As a software engineer passionate about game development, I embarked on a journey to create a Tower Defense game that challenges players through strategic planning and real-time decision-making. This project serves as a platform for honing my skills in Python and Pygame and as a creative outlet to explore game mechanics, design principles, and the intricacies of balancing and player engagement.

In this Tower Defense game, players are tasked with defending their base — symbolized by a princess — from waves of advancing enemies. To succeed, players must strategically place towers along the enemies' path. Each tower has unique capabilities, including different attack speeds, ranges, and damage outputs. As players progress through the waves, they face increasingly difficult groups of enemies, compelling them to optimize tower placement and to make use of upgrades to enhance their defenses.

How to play:

-   Start the Game: Launch the game to enter the main game screen.
-   Place Towers: Click on the desired location within the play area to place a tower. Towers automatically attack enemies within range.
-   Strategy: Carefully plan your tower placement to cover all possible paths and maximize your defensive capabilities.
-   Progress Through Waves: Survive as many waves as possible. The game's difficulty increases with each new wave, introducing faster, stronger enemies.
-   Defend the Princess: The game ends if an enemy reaches the princess zone at the bottom of the screen. Aim for the highest score by lasting as many waves as possible.

This software was developed with the dual goals of deepening my understanding of game development processes and challenging myself to create engaging balanced gameplay. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical project, dealing with real-world programming challenges such as game loop management, collision detection, and dynamic content generation. Furthermore, this project served as a playground for exploring more advanced topics like procedural generation and AI behaviors within the context of a Tower Defense game.
